The optional parameters nsave and nwrite determine the intervals for storing the solution and writing to file, i.e., if nsave > 1 only every nsave'th solution is actually stored, and every nwrite'th time step the solution is stored to disk.\n\nThe other constructors, either passing a TimeSeries and a DataSeries or a filename are used to read data from previous simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"}]
